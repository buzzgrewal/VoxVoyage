## How It Works

1. **User Input & Voice Cloning:**  
   - Upload a short voice sample to create a personalized speaker embedding.
   - Adjust parameters like speaking rate and pitch using intuitive controls.

2. **Interactive Narrative Structure:**  
   - The story is defined as a series of interconnected nodes. Each node contains narrative text, an associated emotion, and multiple user choices.
   - Every decision triggers the generation of a new audio segment using Zonos AI.

3. **Audio Processing & Concatenation:**  
   - Each new audio segment is saved as a temporary file for immediate playback.
   - Simultaneously, the new segment is concatenated with previous segments to form a complete, cumulative audio file of the entire story.

4. **User Interfaces:**  
   - **Gradio Interface:** Offers a modern, web-based UI for interactive storytelling.
   - **CLI Interface:** Provides a command-line option for developers to test and debug core functionalities.
